## Current Status

* Project directory structure initialized.
* Basic `.gitignore` and `README.md` created.
* Conda `environment.yml` and `src/utils/config.py` set up.
* **Phase 1: Core Data Foundation** completed with basic raw data ingestion (`yfinance`).
* **Phase 2: Advanced Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering** completed:
    * `src/data_processing/feature_engineering.py` for technical and statistical features.
    * `src/data_processing/data_preparation.py` for temporal train-test splitting and feature scaling.
    * Processed features, labels, and backtesting data saved to `data/processed/`.
* **Phase 3: Multi-Model Machine Learning Development & Evaluation** completed:
    * `src/models/traditional_ml/rf_model.py` and `xgb_model.py` for training and evaluating RandomForest and XGBoost classifiers.
    * `src/models/model_zoo.py` for central model loading.
    * Trained models saved to `models_trained/archived/`.
    * `notebooks/model_training_evaluation.ipynb` for interactive model development and assessment.
* **Phase 4: Robust Backtesting & Performance Analysis** completed:
    * `configs/strategy_configs/default_strategy.yaml` created for externalizing strategy parameters.
    * `src/alpha_strategies/strategy_logic.py` updated to generate trading signals from ML predictions.
    * `src/alpha_strategies/risk_management.py` provides basic position sizing.
    * `src/backtesting/backtester.py` implemented as a vectorized backtesting engine with commission and slippage.
    * `src/backtesting/performance_metrics.py` for calculating standard quant performance metrics.
    * `src/backtesting/visualization.py` for plotting equity curves and drawdowns.
    * Backtest results (equity curve, metrics, trade log, plots) saved to `reports/backtest_results/`.
    * `notebooks/backtest_analysis.ipynb` for running and analyzing backtests.

## Next Steps

* **Phase 5: Performance Optimization & C++ Integration Discussion:**
    * Profile critical sections of the Python code.
    * Discuss strategies for C++ integration for performance-sensitive components (e.g., highly optimized feature calculation or low-latency simulation).
